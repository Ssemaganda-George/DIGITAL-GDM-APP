    "For women with well-controlled gestational diabetes (GDM) managed by diet and lifestyle (GDM A1), induction is generally recommended at 41 weeks, but can be discussed at 40 weeks. For women with GDM requiring medication (GDM A2), induction is recommended at 39 weeks. Macrosomia, or large fetal size, can influence the decision, with cesarean delivery being considered if the estimated fetal weight exceeds 4500 g to avoid birth trauma. Regular third-trimester ultrasounds should be done to assess fetal size and guide discussions on the risks and benefits of induction versus cesarean delivery.",
    "Managing gestational diabetes (GDM) and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in pregnancy is crucial to minimize complications for both mother and child. While the best screening, diagnostic tests, and management practices for GDM are still debated, strict guidelines may improve pregnancy outcomes. Postpartum screening and long-term monitoring are essential due to the increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life for women who had GDM. Lifestyle interventions and metformin can significantly reduce this progression.",
    "A history of shoulder dystocia significantly increases the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. Shoulder dystocia recurs in about 12% of vaginal births and poses higher morbidity for the neonate. The rate of neonatal brachial plexus palsy increases from 19 per 1000 in the first occurrence to 45 per 1000 in recurrent cases, a relative increase of 136%. This high risk often leads clinicians and patients to opt for cesarean delivery in subsequent pregnancies to avoid complications.",
    "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by hyperglycemia with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Key findings highlight that early diagnosis and blood glucose control improve maternal and fetal outcomes. Prevention through lifestyle interventions such as diet and physical activity is crucial. Treatment strategies include nutritional intervention and exercise, with medical treatment necessary if these are ineffective. Novel non-pharmacologic agents like myo-inositol show promise in both prevention and treatment of GDM. Despite these advances, the lack of universally accepted criteria complicates the diagnosis and prognosis of GDM.",
    "Lifestyle modifications can effectively prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM), who are at increased risk. Despite strong evidence supporting these interventions, current recommendations for postpartum follow-up are inconsistent, and compliance is often poor. Developing effective intervention strategies and improving follow-up care are crucial public health challenges that require further research and translation into practice."
